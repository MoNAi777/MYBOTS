PWA Icons for Data Organizer

You need to create two icon files for the PWA:

1. icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)

These icons should be placed in this directory.

You can create these icons using any image editing software like:
- Adobe Photoshop
- GIMP (free)
- Figma
- Canva

Suggested icon design:
- Use a simple, recognizable symbol related to data organization or messaging
- Use the app's primary color (#3b82f6 - blue)
- Make sure the icon looks good on both light and dark backgrounds
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes

Once you've created the icons, place them in this directory with the exact filenames mentioned above.
